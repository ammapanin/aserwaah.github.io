title: Further explanation for the existence of this blog.
---

Since I grew up and started wandering around for education and adventure, I have met many people who have not met many Africans, and sometimes I talk to them, and many times our conversations happen as follows:
<br>

<span class="important">
They say, "Where are you from?"
<br>I say, "I am from Ghana, but I grew up in Southern Africa, mostly in Botswana and Swaziland."
<br> They say, "Oh, my Aunt was in Kenya last year!"
</span>
<br>
<span class="important">
Or they say, "What are you working on these days?"<br>
I say, excitedly, because we just got a bunch of fancy research funding, "I am starting this project looking at religious giving in Ghana. We think we might do it experimentally. But we have no idea how to control for real beliefs-"<br>
They say, interrupting my instict to ramble, but full of concern, "Oh! Aren't you worried about Ebola?"
</span>
<br>
<span class="important">
Sometimes they say, "Can I touch your hair?"<br>
And I say nothing meaningful.
</span>

<span class="important">
And then, there is another conversation I have, where we are talking about Nordic countries or the differences between Toulousains and Bordelais, and someone says, "Swedish Finns are so different from other Finns. They have this rich complex history of two cultures living together." The conversation meanders in this manner, we split fine blond hairs, then someone remembers me, and as an afterthought, "By the way Amma, what are things like in Africa?" 
</span>

There is a part of me that accepts, and possibly even finds reasonable, that to the garden variety Swedish Finn, one poor person from Uganda is not very distinguishable from another poor person from The Gambia. However, it is still extremely annoying to remember that in the imaginations of many people I interact with, the gigantic landmass that is my home continent is blurred together in heaving hordes of hungry black people (on whose behalf all my European friends cleared their plates when they were children). This unfortunately means that a large number of my daily interactions are conducted on a basis where all my homes, all my adventures, my family, my friends are bundled into one large, uninteresting heap of tropical deprivation. This is a situation I obviously don't find ideal. 

However, in the last few years (education, adventure, etc.) I have persisted in lining up for visas and gallivanting back and forth between countries with high GDPs full of white people, and countries with low GDPs full of people of duskier shades. In the process, I have thought a lot about race, nationality, representation, images of others, I once got caught in a conversation with an enumerator in India who was extolling the virtues of Hitler as a vegetarian. My main problem currently is that I cannot always hijack those conversations with my friends and make them run off with me along tangents I want to explore (Is blackface really okay in the Netherlands just because they don't have a minstrel tradition? Isn't it a bit funny that Germans like to insist that they don't have a colonial history when all sorts of funny power brokering in late 19th century Europe helped shaped Britain and France's tropical adventures. Also, [Little Popo](https://books.google.de/books?id=TpyfBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA230&lpg=PA230&dq=little+popo+germany&source=bl&ots=lPa16naxmA&sig=DrrcINxWwyWvdF3R5_s1mDKRBRk&hl=fr&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj-ityjlILLAhXGYQ8KHTdLA68Q6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=little%20popo%20germany&f=false)). Instead, I get stuck repeatedly explaining how far away Swaziland is from Botswana and how many hours I sat to do my braids (on average 5, but it varies. No, it is not my real hair.)

So I have staked my corner of the internet to make my case, at my leisure, for the places I come from. Finagling about with data is what I do with my life, and how I hope to use my blog to create more considered narratives of places I find interesting and to share them with people I care about.
