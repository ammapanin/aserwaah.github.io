I&nbsp;am&nbsp;an&nbsp;assistant professor of economics at the University of
Louvain and I study how risk and uncertainty shape economic decision
making. I am particularly interested in how contemporary
religious institutions provide substitutes to insurance and
other services that might otherwise be provided by formal markets. I have
experience running a variety of lab, field, and
lab-type field experiments in what some coauthors insist on calling “exotic places”.
