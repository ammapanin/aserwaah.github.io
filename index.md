I am an economist working in the World Bank Office of the Chief
Economist for the Africa region. I study how risk and
uncertainty shape economic decision making. Some current work looks at
how religious institutions in developing countries act as insurers. I
have approached many questions through a variety of lab, field, and
lab-type field experiments in what some coauthors insist on calling
“exotic places”. Please click [*here for my CV*](assets/Panin_CV_Jun20.pdf).
