I am an economist based at the Nuffield College [Centre for
Experimental Social Sciences](https://cess-nuffield.nuff.ox.ac.uk/),
where I am a Postdoctoral Research Officer and a Fellow of Nuffield
College. My work explores how risk and uncertainty shape
economic decision making. At the moment I am particularly excited
about a couple of empirical and theoretical papers looking at how religious institutions in developing
countries act as insurers. Insurance may be one amongst many financial
roles and religious organisations may be partial informal substitutes
for weak formal institutions. I have approached many questions through a variety of lab, field, and lab-type field experiments in
what some coauthors insist on calling "exotic places". Please click
