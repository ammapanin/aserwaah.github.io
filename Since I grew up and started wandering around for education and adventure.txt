Since I grew up and started wandering around for education and adventure, I have met many people, who haven’t met many Africans, and sometimes I talk to them and many times our conversations happen as follows:They say, “Where are you from”?I say, “I am from Ghana, but I grew up in Southern Africa, mostly in Botswana and Swaziland.”They say, “Oh, my Aunt was in Kenya last year!”Or they say, “What are you working on these days?”I say, excitedly, because we just got a bunch of fancy research funding, “I am just starting this project looking at religious giving in Ghana. We think we might do it experimentally – you know, experiments being the gold standard and all. But we have no idea how to control for real beliefs-”They say, interrupting me with concern, “Oh, aren’t you worried about Ebola?”Sometimes they say, “Can I touch your hair?”And I say,  “--”.
