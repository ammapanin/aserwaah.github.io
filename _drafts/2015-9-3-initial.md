title: What I am doing here. (Maybe, what am I doing here?)
---

Since I grew up and started wandering around for education and adventure, I have met many people who have not met many Africans, and sometimes I talk to them, and many times our conversations happen as follows:
<br>

<span class="important">
They say, "Where are you from?"
<br>I say, "I am from Ghana, but I grew up in Southern Africa, mostly in Botswana and Swaziland."
<br> They say, "Oh, my Aunt was in Kenya last year!"
</span>
<br>
<span class="important">
Or they say, "What are you working on these days?"<br>
I say, excitedly, because we just got a bunch of fancy research funding, "I am just starting this project looking at religious giving in Ghana. We think we might do it experimentally - you know, experiments being the gold standard and all. But we have no idea how to control for real beliefs-"<br>
They say, interrupting my instict to ramble, but full of concern, "Oh! Aren't you worried about Ebola?"
</span>
<br>
<span class="important">
Sometimes they say, "Can I touch your hair?"<br>
And I say nothing meaningful.
</span>

I would like a place on the internet where I can send my friends who ask me questions about Africa. I would like to play around with maps and graphs and test ideas. 


<span class="important">
There is another conversation I have, where we are talking about Nordic countries or the differences between Toulousains and Bordelais, and someone says, "Swedish Finns are so different from other Finns. They have this rich complex history of two cultures living together." The conversation meanders in this manner, we split fine blond hairs, then someone remembers me, and as an afterthought, "By the way Amma, what are things like in Africa?" 
</span>
<br>
And I know, that to the average Swedish Finn, one poor black person from Uganda is not very distinguishable from another poor black person from The Gambia. But I fear that this unifying feature - the fact of all those poor black people (on whose behalf all my European friends cleared their plates when they were children) - tightly binds all my homes, all my adventures, my family, my friends into one giant, uninteresting tropical bundle of deprivation, a conclusion I obviously don't find ideal. 

So I have staked my corner of the internet -  this endless Tr√∂delladen of data and information - and I will use this blog to make my case for the places I come from.
