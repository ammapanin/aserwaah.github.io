title: What I am doing here. (Maybe, what am I doing here?)
---

Since I grew up and started wandering around for education and adventure, I have met many people who have not met many Africans, and sometimes I talk to them, and many times our conversations happen as follows:
<br>

<span class="important">
They say, "Where are you from?"
<br>I say, "I am from Ghana, but I grew up in Southern Africa, mostly in Botswana and Swaziland."
<br> They say, "Oh, my Aunt was in Kenya last year!"
</span>
<br>
<span class="important">
Or they say, "What are you working on these days?"<br>
I say, excitedly, because we just got a bunch of fancy research funding, "I am just starting this project looking at religious giving in Ghana. We think we might do it experimentally. But we have no idea how to control for real beliefs-"<br>
They say, interrupting my instict to ramble, but full of concern, "Oh! Aren't you worried about Ebola?"
</span>
<br>
<span class="important">
Sometimes they say, "Can I touch your hair?"<br>
And I say nothing meaningful.
</span>

<span class="important">
And then, there is another conversation I have, where we are talking about Nordic countries or the differences between Toulousains and Bordelais, and someone says, "Swedish Finns are so different from other Finns. They have this rich complex history of two cultures living together." The conversation meanders in this manner, we split fine blond hairs, then someone remembers me, and as an afterthought, "By the way Amma, what are things like in Africa?" 
</span>

The thing is I know, and possibly even find it perfectly reasonable, that to the average Swedish Finn, one poor black person from Uganda is not very distinguishable from another poor black person from The Gambia. But I fear that this unifying feature that they choose to latch onto when the thought of the gigantic landmass that is my home continent happens to tickle the edge of their concerns - the fact of all those poor black people (on whose behalf all my European friends cleared their plates when they were children) - means that maybe 70% (imprecisely estimated) of my interactions about Africa are conducted on a basis where all my homes, all my adventures, my family, my friends are bundled into one large, uninteresting heap of tropical deprivation. This is a situation I obviously don't find ideal. 

However, in the last few years (education, adventure, etc.) I have persisted in lining up for visas and gallivanting back and forth between countries with high GDPs full of white people, and countries with low GDPs full of people of duskier shades. In the process, I have thought a lot about race, nationality, representation, and so on. My main problem currently is that I cannot always hijack those conversations with my friends and make them run off with me along tangents I want to explore (Is blackface really okay in the Netherlands because they don't have a minstrel tradition? Why are Germans so fond of insisting that Germany doesn't have a colonial history when it seems that the Prussians were happily finagling about the late 19th century playing power broker between England and France?). Instead, I get stuck repeatedly explaining how far away Swaziland is from Botswana and how many hours I sat to do my braids (on average 5, but it varies. No, it is not my real hair.)

So I have staked my corner of the internet - this endless Tr√∂delladen of data and information - to make my case, at my leisure, for the places I come from. This business of my education, which mostly invovles rooting around the outskirts of the development economics discipline, means that I am at least in priciple comfortable with large amounts of data and I can do things with statistics. These are skills I hope to use in my blog to create more considered narratives of places I find interesting and to share them with people I care about.
