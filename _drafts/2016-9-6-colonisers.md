title: Colonial narratives
---

I often wonder what the variety of colonisers were looking for when they left their homes. I think about this frequently - all those white people dying of fevers, the slave traders and teachers, and their Christianising missions, the Boer farmers trekking to freedom. What were they looking for, and how did these encounters entail so much humiliation and subjugation for the people who turned out to be colonised, but surely also for the colonisers. In the past couple of months I read three very different novels with themes that sketch answers to these questions. They provoked me enough to share them.

**The white man's burden to be loved.**

*The Splendor of Portugal* Antonio Lobes Antunes
<pre class = "bookquote"><span>...there are times when I think I should have, could have, that it would have been easy to have had a different life, even here in Africa where we came
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my father used to explain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not in search of money or power but black people with no money or power at all who could give us the illusion of having money and power which in fact we wouldn't have even if we did have it since the people in Lisbon only tolerated us, nothing more, they looked down on us the same way we looked down on the people who worked for us and thus in a way we were their blacks, just like the blacks have their own blacks, and those blacks have their blacks, and so on going down from one level to the next to the absolute depths of disease and misery, cripples, lepers, the slaves of slaves, dogs

**Next time, we choose the piece of paper**

*Ama* Manu Herbstein
<pre class = "bookquote"><span> "In the beginning,” said the storyteller, “Onyame, creator of all things, made three black men and three whites. To each of these he gave a woman of the same colour. The six blacks were our first ancestors and the others were the ancestors of the whites.
   “Onyame set before them two things: a large clay pot and a piece of paper, folded and sealed. Then he made them draw lots and, the black men winning, he gave them the first choice. They discussed the matter amongst themselves.
   “The first said, 'Of what use is a piece of paper?'
   “The second replied, 'None, and the pot is large; in it we shall surely find everything we need.'
   "The third said, 'Let us take the pot.'
   “So they took the pot. But when they broke it open all they found was a piece of gold and a piece of iron.”
   The story-teller paused to wet his throat.
   “Now it was the turn of the white men. When they opened the paper and examined it they found it told them everything there was to know.
   “Then Onyame gave this country to the blacks. Leaving them in the bush, he took the whites to the mouth of the great water and taught them to cut down trees and build a ship. When the ship was ready they boarded it and sailed away to a far country which Onyame had prepared for those who would select the paper.
   "Many years later the descendants of the first whites returned to this country with goods to exchange for gold and slaves. It is from that paper that they had learned to make the goods.
   "That is the end of my story.”
   There was silence around the camp fire as the slaves and their guards reflected upon the significance of the tale.
   "These white men," Ama asked a guard who had become her friend and who sat nearby, "What are they like?"
"They are very tall, twice as tall as we are, and very ugly. They are so ugly that it hurts ones eyes to look at them. Indeed, if you look at them for too long, you are sure to become blind." Ama shuddered.
    "What do they eat?"
    "They eat all the things that we eat. Like us, they like meat best. But their favourite is human flesh."

**The weak are meat the strong do eat.**

*Cloud Atlas* David Mitchell

<pre class = "bookquote"><span> After Preacher Horrox had said grace over the bowls of turtle soup & invoked God’s blessing on his new business venture with Cpt. Molyneux, he sermonized upon a much-beloved topic as we ate. 
       “I have always unswervingly held, that God, in our Civilizing World, manifests himself not in the Miracles of the Biblical Age, but in Progress. It is Progress that leads Humanity up the ladder towards the Godhead. No Jacob’s Ladder this, no, but rather ‘Civilization’s Ladder,’ if you will. Highest of all the races on this ladder stands the Anglo-Saxon. The Latins are a rung or two below. Lower still are Asiatics—a hardworking race, none can deny, yet lacking our Aryan bravery. Sinologists insist they once aspired to greatness, but where is your yellow-hued Shakespeare, eh, or your almond-eyed da Vinci? Point made, point taken. Lower down, we have the Negro. Good-tempered ones may be trained to work profitably, though a rumbunctious one is the Devil incarnate! The American Indian, too, is capable of useful chores on the Californian barrios, is that not so, Mr. Ewing?”
<center>...</center>
One Mr. Gosling (fiancé of Preacher Horrox’s eldest daughter) wrung his hands in oleaginous admiration. “If I dare be so bold, sir, it strikes me as almost … yes, a deprivation to let your theorem go unpublished, sir. ‘The Horrox Ladder of Civilization’ would set the Royal Society alight!”
      Preacher Horrox said, “No, Mr. Gosling, my work is here. The Pacific must find itself another Descartes, another Cuvier.”
      “Wise of you, Preacher”-Henry clapped a flying insect & examined its remains-”to keep your theory to yourself.”
      Our host could not conceal his irritation. “How so?”
      “Why, under scrutiny it is obvious a ‘theorem’ is redundant when a simple law suffices.”
      “What law would that be, sir?”
      “The first of ‘Goose’s Two Laws of Survival.’ It runs thus, ‘The weak are meat the strong do eat.’ ”
      “But your ‘simple law’ is blind to the fundamental mystery, ‘Why do White races hold dominion over the world?’ ”
      Henry chuckled & loaded an imaginary musket, aimed down its barrel, narrowed his eye, then startled the company with a “Bang! Bang! Bang! See? Got him before he blew his blowpipe!”
      Mrs. Derbyshire uttered a dismayed “Oh!”
      Henry shrugged. “Where is the fundamental mystery?”
      Preacher Horrox had lost his good humour. “Your implication is that White races rule the globe not by divine grace but by the musket? But such an assertion is merely the same mystery dressed up in borrowed clothes! How is it that the musket came to the White man & not, say, the Esquimeau or the Pygmy, if not by august will of the Almighty?”
      Henry obliged. “Our weaponry was not dropped onto our laps one morning. It is not manna from Sinai’s skies. Since Agincourt, the White man has refined & evolved the gunpowder sciences until our modern armies may field muskets by the tens of thousands! ‘Aha!’ you will ask, yes, ‘But why us Aryans? Why not the Unipeds of Ur or the Mandrakes of Mauritius?’ Because, Preacher, of all the world’s races, our love-or rather our rapacity-for treasure, gold, spices & dominion, oh, most of all, sweet dominion, is the keenest, the hungriest, the most unscrupulous! This rapacity, yes, powers our Progress; for ends infernal or divine I know not. Nor do you know, sir. Nor do I overly care. I feel only gratitude that my Maker cast me on the winning side.
