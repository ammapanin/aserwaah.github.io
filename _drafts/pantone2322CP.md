title: Who are you calling black?
---

If you were to paint a wall the colour of my hand, you would ask for Pantone 2322 CP. Those are the preliminaries. That is largely my skin colour. (Friction, causes foolishly by sitting down ahas turned my bottom raven black. This is not aesthetically true, but possibly my favourite poem in the world.)
