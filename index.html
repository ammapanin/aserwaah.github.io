<p>I am a PhD candidate in economics. My research focuses on the interactions between poverty and decision making behaviour. </p>
<br>
<p>Both in the course of my PhD, and in the lives that preceeded it, my work has taken me to terrible, gnarled depths of extremely large and messy datasets, from which I occasionally emerge triumphant. A blog seems like a suitable place to document some of this quest - as an easy means of recording snippets of code, and as a commitment device whose publicity might make me do this consistently and conscientiously.</p> 
<br>
<p>
I have a second motive. The map below shows where I am from - nowhere in particular really, but somewhere distinctly African. A personal blog also seems like a good place to rant occasionally about people who say stupid things about Africa.
</p>
<br>
Self advertisement it seems is an important part of being a fledgling academic. I have put links to my research appropriately at the <a href = research.html/> research</a>. I have also been finagling about with a trotro mapping project, as well as some other small time coding adventures. Code and documentation for these (mostly links to my Github page) can be found under <a href = projects.html/> projects</a>.
