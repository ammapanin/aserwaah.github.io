I am a PhD candidate in economics. My research focuses on the interactions between poverty and decision making behaviour. Both in the course of my PhD, and in the lives that preceeded it, my work has taken me to terrible, gnarled depths of extremely large and messy datasets, from which I occasionally emerge triumphant. A blog seems like a suitable place to document some of this quest - as an easy means of recording snippets of code, and as a commitment device whose publicity might make me do this consistently and conscientiously. The map below shows where I am from - nowhere in particular really, but somewhere distinctly African. These peregrine gallivants have shaped my worldview. A blog also seems like a good place to rant occasionally about people who say stupid things about Africa.
