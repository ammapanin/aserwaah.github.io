<h1>About me and this blog </h1>

<div class="posts">
  <p>I am a PhD candidate in economics. My research focuses on the interactions between poverty and decision making behaviour. However, this blog is my side hustle. I want to use my time lurking on the internet and my skills working with data to help make people less stupid about Africa.
</p>
<p> About me see my animated map below.
</p>
<!-- <p>Both in the course of my PhD, and in the lives that preceeded it, my work has taken me to terrible, gnarled depths of extremely large and messy datasets. Occasionally, I emerge triumphantly from these. A blog seems like a suitable place to document some of this quest - as an easy means of recording coding solutions I have worked out, and as a commitment device whose publicity might make me do this consistently and conscientiously.</p>  -->
<!-- <br> -->
<!-- <p> -->
<!-- I have a second motive. It is probably the real driver of this project. The map below shows where I am from. At this point, I don't think I come from a particular place, but this nebulous entity is distinctly African. Most people I know know vanishingly little about my home continent. The treasures of the internet are vast and I spend a lot of time combing them for more information about my homes. I use these to make graphs and charts, sometimes even with animation. My second goal with this blog is to help make people less stupid about Africa. -->

<!-- Finally, self advertisement is not a goal, but it seems to be a good idea for a fledgling researcher. Descriptions of my current projects are on the <a href = research.html/> research</a> page. Those will turn to papers at a rate that is roughly inversely proportional to the frequency of blogging. <\!--I have also been finagling about with a trotro mapping project, as well as some other small time coding adventures. Code and documentation for these (mostly links to my Github page) can be found under <a href = projects.html/> projects</a>. -\-> -->
<!-- I try to document all my code. Anything that is not described in a blog post should be found on my <a href = https://github.com/aserwaah> Github</a> page. Most of what I know, I owe to other people. If anything I write is incorrectly referenced, please let me know. -->
